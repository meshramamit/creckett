A betting app for cricket - developed for T20 format games

IPL - Indian Premier League, a league in India for Cricket started in 2008. This turned out to be a huge success in India as a country of billion people follow this game as never before. Cricket which is more famous for one-day (50 overs) and Test (5 days) was trimmed down for limited 20 overs. And this made me think about an opportunity wherein you can play a game "betting" for fun with your friends as its a shorter and fast paced.
