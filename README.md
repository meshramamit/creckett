A betting app for cricket - developed for T20 format games

IPL - Indian Premier League, a league in India for Cricket started in 2008. This turned out to be a huge success in India as a country of billion people followed this game as never before. Cricket which is more famous for one-day (50 overs) and Test (5 days) was trimmed down for limited 20 overs. And this made me think about an opportunity wherein you can play a game "betting" for fun with your friends as its a shorter and fast paced.

As per the initial version of the app which was only accessible through web, a friend would login through Facebook (only authentication available) and invite any of his existing friends to play.

First, he will see a list of all the upcoming matches and depending upon the match he wish to play - he'd invite his friends. The friend recieves a notification and he/she can join to play afer accepting the challenge.

When the game airs live, both friends can now bet on how much runs would be scored on that particular over. Both player needs to predict the runs scored for a particular over before the third ball is balled by the bowler. Once the over is complete, person who predicts the right score wins some points. They can predict both runs and wickets. Over time, they accumulate points and player who predicts the most wins the game.

The app would poll live feeds and check the score per over and validates the prediction.
